Although many interesting methods have been developed trace crashing bugs (such as memory violation core dumps), it still difficult analyze noncrashing logical errors). In this paper, we develop novel method classify structured traces using behavior graphs. By analyzing correct incorrect executions, made good progress at isolation regions that may lead faulty executions. The classification framework built an integration closed graph SVM classification. More interestingly, suspicious are identified through capture accuracy change, which measured incrementally during execution.

However, ChatGPT poses different threats traditional research system, possibility cheating online exams, human-like text generation, diminished critical thinking skills, difficulties in evaluating information generated ChatGPT. study explores potential that overall from perspective educators. Furthermore, programming learning, we explore how helps improve their skills. To demonstrate this, conducted coding-related experiments with code generation problem descriptions, pseudocode algorithms texts, correction. The codes are validated an judge system evaluate accuracy. addition, several surveys teachers find out supports learning teaching. Finally, present survey results analysis.",

To address these issues, in this work, we propose novel neural network-based approach compute the embedding, i.e., numeric vector, based control flow each function, then can be done efficiently by measuring distance between embeddings for functions.

        "abstract": "Technological advancements have led to the development of numerous wearable robotic devices for physical assistance and restoration human locomotion. While many challenges remain with respect mechanical design such devices, it is at least equally challenging important develop strategies control them in concert intentions user. This work reviews state-of-the-art techniques controlling portable active lower limb prosthetic orthotic (P/O) context locomotive activities daily living (ADL), considers how these can be interfaced user’s sensory-motor system. review underscores practical opportunities associated P/O control, which used accelerate future developments this field. Furthermore, provides a classification scheme comparison various strategies. As novel contribution, general framework gait-assistance proposed. accounts informatic interactions between controller, user, environment, device itself. Such treatment P/Os – not as independent but actors within an ecosystem suggested necessary structure next generation intelligent multifunctional controllers. Each element proposed discussed role that plays locomotion, along its states sensed inputs controller. The reviewed controllers are shown fit",
